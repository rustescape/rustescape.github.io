<h4 class='t4'>Professional rust converter – primer EVA-022 represents one-component polymer system which
 is water based and consisting of a the basis (dispersion of PVA with particle size up to 1500 nanometers, 
 target additives, water) and orthophosphoric acid.
It is intended for processing rusty (thickness of the layer of the corrosion products no more than 120 microns)
 steel surfaces in building structures, in railway transport, motor transport, ship repair, in the repair of bridges, 
 overpasses, containers, tanks, pipelines, heating mains, etc., to convert corrosion products to the  primer under any paints and 
 varnishes. Completely stops corrosion.
Influence: seeps through a layer of corrosion products to the metal surface and dissolves it, 
forming on it a protective anticorrosive layer of iron phosphate in thickness up to 20 microns. 
As a result of the chemical reaction, the corrosion products are converted, as the solvent-water evaporates are
 glued together by a binding
 dispersion into a solid, irreversible film of polymers having excellent adhesion to the phosphate layer. 
 Do not need expensive surface treatment. Expensive processing of thesurface isn't necessary . It is only necessary to remove loose, 
 exfoliating rust.                                         
​ Apply in one layer with a brush, roller or spraying.  The water-based composition is also allowed to apply to a wet surface. If necessary, water is used as the solvent.   Drying time at  temperature (20±2) ºС is 
up to 2 hours. Time of full polymerization is 15-20 hours.  Single Layer consumption is up to 120gr/m2.
 The appearance of repeated rust (without surface coating) under atmospheric conditions is not observed for at least 8 years. To store and apply at  temperature + (3 - 25) ºС.             It is not fire and explosion hazard matterial,
 does not contain VOC (organic solvents).
Detailed information of hazards and precautions is located on the labels of the formulations.<br>
